# BCD
BCD extended to support a big part of ASCII (escapable to UTF-8) and compress characters into 4 bits

Problem: Sending data (mostly numerical) by Radio must be done in a compressed way. Compression algorithms are often complex and not "programmer friendly". We make a proposal based on the lessons of history: the Hollerith code from 1930 !
